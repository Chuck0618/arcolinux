## How To Play Ways to Play Uno
### Materials Needed
One deck of Uno cards.

### Rules
 Basically, this is a collection of different ways you can play Uno. For those who don't know, Uno is a fun card game in which players try to get rid of all of their cards using colors, numbers, and other techniques. First, let's get started with the basic question...how do do you play normal Uno? (If you know, you can skip this, but you can use it to thoroughly teach your students.)

### Classic:
1) Shuffle the cards and pass them out to the players. They should each receive seven cards (or more or less, but seven is suggested.) Take the remaining pile and place it in the center, cards facing down. Then take the top card off the deck and place it face up next to the deck.
2) Determine the turn order and let the first person play. Any card can be valid as long as
a. The card is the same color as a card in your deck
b. The card has the same number as a card in your deck
c. You have a wild card of any type
If none of these are true, you must keep drawing cards until you come up with a drawing card. Most cards have a card a number on them, so you'll have a chance eventually. You can also play a special card of color or of no color.
3) There are various types of special cards in the deck, and they have effects, for better or for sorse, on your opponents. They are...
a. Skip: This has a circle with a cross through it, which is the universal "no" sign. This card allows you to skip the next person's turn, which means they can't play until their turn comes up again.
b. Reverse: When you use this card, it reverses the turn order. For example, if player four used a reverse card, it would then be player three's turn instead of player five's it would then be player two's, then player one's, and so on. You can recognize this card by two different-pointing arrows wrapped around each other.
c. Draw Two: This forces the next player two draw two cards from the deck, even if they have a valid card to play. This card has an image of two cards on it, along with the +2 symbol.
d. Wild Card. If you don't have any normal valid cards, you can use this card, which is black in colour and has a colour wheel on it. This is basically a card that can be used anytime. Save this card for when you've almost ran out of a color or when you don't have a valid card. After using, you can switch what color it is (although no number is designated).
e. Draw Four. This card basically has the same effects of the Draw Two card and the Wild Card combined, only you have to draw four. Also, a player cannot play after they draw four. It simply goes to the player after them. This card is black in colour, has +4 on it, and has a color wheel consisting of cards instead of normal circles.
4. You may think this game can be easily won, and you would be right. However, it's just as easy to keep a game going for hours on end. Sometimes you'll just have to quit because real life interferes. Eventually, though, someone's going to have one card left. When they do, they have to yell "Uno!" so they can keep that card. However, if they're too slow, they will have to draw seven more cards.
The player who gts rid of all their cards first is the winner!

### Nuclear:
1) In this mode, follow all the rules of normal Uno.
2) However, there is one big difference: if a player has the EXACT SAME card as the one in play (same color and number), no matter whose turn it is, they can play it. When doing this, you must call out "Nuclear!"
3) When you do this, the turn order remains the same, but it will immdeiately become the turn of the person before you and go from there. However, with other cards, there are different rules...
a. In the case of a nuclear skip, it would skip over to the player after you.
b. A nuclear reverse has the same effect as a normal nuclear...however, it goes in reverse direction from the player before you. If you were player 3, normally it would be your turn after player two's turn, but it would instead be player 1's turn.
c. In a nuclear Draw Two and Draw Four, the value would keep being doubled if there were no more nuclears left to play. If you nucleared a Draw Four, then the player before you would have to draw eight. In the case of a Draw Four, the person who most recently nucleared it will choose the playing colour.
d. A nuclear wild card has the same properties of a regular nuclear card. The only difference is that you can choose the colour instead of the originally chosen colour.

### German Uno:
1) This game has the same aspects of classic Uno and nuclear Uno. However, when certain numbers are put down, you can do a certain thing.
2) When you place down a two, you can quickly remove two cards from your deck and give them to another person. They will have to accept the cards and keep them until they can play them. However, if the number is changed before you can hand the cards to someone, you will have to take them back. Just to make this game go a little bit quicker, you can make this the same with four.
3) If you place down a 0 (which is rare, yet not incredibly rare), you can quickly switch decks with someone. As with the two card, you have to do this before someone else places a number down. If you do this, you must be careful: you may swap decks with a person who has more cards than you.
